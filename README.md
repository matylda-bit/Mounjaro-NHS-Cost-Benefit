# Mounjaro-NHS-Cost-Benefit
# Mounjaro Injections: Cost-Benefit Analysis for the NHS

**Overview**

This project simulates and analyzes the impact of **Mounjaro injections** on patients suffering from obesity. The goal is to evaluate whether this treatment can offer **cost savings for the NHS**, especially in patients who failed to respond to traditional weight-loss methods (like diet and exercise).

**Objectives**

- Compare BMI before and after Mounjaro treatment.
- Estimate cost per patient vs. potential NHS savings.
- Identify patterns by age, gender, and obesity causes.

**Data Summary**

The dataset contains 100 anonymized, simulated patient records. Key columns include:

- `Patient ID`: Anonymous unique ID
- `Age`, `Gender`
- `Childhood Obesity` or `Other Cause`
- `Traditional Treatment Failed`: Yes/No
- `BMI (Before)` and `BMI (After)`
- `Duration of Treatment (months)`
- `Mounjaro Effective`: Yes/No
- `Cost of Mounjaro`: £300 per month × treatment duration
- `Estimated NHS Savings`: Based on effective outcomes
